# Chess App Development TODO

## Project Overview
**Target Android Version**: Android 10 (API level 29)  
**Test Device**: Galaxy S9 (runs Android 10)  
**App Purpose**: A chess app for beginners and casual players

### Core Features
- [x] Play against bots
- [ ] Bots should be adjustable
  - [ ] Players can choose any difficulty Level 0.0-50.0
  - [ ] Game over suggests next difficulty
- [x] Intuitive and beginner-friendly UI

### Development Approach
- [x] Add one feature at a time
- [x] Test after each step

### DEVELOPMENT CONSTRAINT RULE
ðŸ”’ **MINIMAL CODE UPDATE CONSTRAINT** ðŸ”’
- **Write all of the actual code that would be changed**
- **But minimally - don't write the whole file**
- **Show only the specific parts being added or modified**
- **For removed code, just describe what needs removed (e.g., function signatures)**
- **This constraint ensures focused, manageable development steps**
- **Always specify the exact location and what would be modified**

---

## Development Steps

### Step 1: Setup project and basic UI âœ…
- [x] Create a new Android Studio project targeting Android 10
- [x] Show a simple home screen with a "Play" button
- [x] Run and test this on emulator
- [x] Set up Git repository and version control

### Step 2: Basic chess board UI without game logic âœ…
- [x] Display chess board with 8x8 grid
- [x] Initialize chess pieces in starting positions
- [x] Add visual distinction between light/dark squares
- [x] Implement square selection with visual feedback
- [x] Add navigation between home screen and chess board
- [x] Test board display and selection functionality

### Step 3: Implement chess game logic âœ…
- [x] Add basic piece movement (tap to select, tap to move)
- [x] Implement turn-based gameplay (white/black alternating)
- [x] Add move validation for each piece type:
  - [x] Pawn movement (forward, capture diagonally)
  - [x] Rook movement (horizontal/vertical)
  - [x] Bishop movement (diagonal)
  - [x] Knight movement (L-shape)
  - [x] Queen movement (combination of rook/bishop)
  - [x] King movement (one square in any direction)
- [x] Add visual feedback for valid moves
- [x] Implement game state management and turn tracking
- [x] Add move history display
- [x] Test piece movement and rule validation
### Step 4: Add a simple AI bot âœ… (mostly complete)
- [x] Create basic bot that makes random legal moves
- [x] Allow playing against this bot
- [x] Add game mode selection (Human vs Human / Human vs AI)
- [x] Implement AI thinking delay for realism
- [x] Add AI status display ("AI is thinking...")
- [ ] **BUG FIX**: Fix game status text - currently shows wrong player after moves
- [ ] **FEATURE**: Highlight AI's last move (from and to squares) for better visibility
- [ ] **REFACTOR**: Move duplicate chess logic to shared utility class
- [ ] **TESTING**: Test AI bot gameplay extensively
- [ ] **POLISH**: Add game mode selection UI on home screen âœ…

#### Step 4 Remaining Tasks:
1. **Bug Fixes** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Fix game status text logic (currently backwards)
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Add move highlighting (show from/to squares of last move for all players)

2. **Code Refactoring** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Create `ChessLogic.kt` or `ChessUtils.kt` to eliminate duplicate code
- Move `getValidMoves()`, `getRookMoves()`, `getBishopMoves()`, `isValidPosition()` to shared file
- Update both `ChessAI.kt` and `ChessBoard.kt` to use shared logic

3. **UI Improvements**
- Add game mode selection on home screen âœ…
- Improve AI status messages
- Add restart game functionality

4. **Testing & Bug Fixes**
- Test AI moves thoroughly
- Ensure AI cannot move human pieces
- Test edge cases (no valid moves, etc.)

### Step 5: Improve AI difficulty ðŸ”„ (next major step)
- [ ] **REFACTOR FIRST**: Complete Step 4 refactoring before starting
- [ ] Implement adaptive difficulty system (Level 0.0-50.0)
- [ ] Create difficulty slider/picker in settings
- [ ] Implement move evaluation algorithm that can be tuned
- [ ] Add post-game difficulty suggestions based on performance
- [ ] Add bot "thinking" time variation based on difficulty
- [ ] Test and balance difficulty across full range

### Step 6: Add advanced chess rules ðŸ”„
- [ ] Implement check detection
- [ ] Prevent moves that would leave king in check
- [ ] Add checkmate detection
- [ ] Add stalemate detection
- [ ] Implement castling (kingside and queenside)
- [ ] Add en passant capture
- [ ] Implement pawn promotion
- [ ] Test all special rules

### Step 7: Enhance UI/UX ðŸ”„
- [ ] Add hints and move suggestions for beginners
- [ ] Show captured pieces
- [ ] Add game settings (difficulty, hints on/off)
- [ ] Add beginner-friendly features like explanations
- [ ] Improve visual design and animations
- [ ] Add sound effects for moves
- [ ] Implement piece animations for moves

### Step 8: Testing & polishing ðŸ”„
- [ ] Test extensively on Galaxy S9
- [ ] Fix bugs and improve performance
- [ ] Add app icon and branding
- [ ] Test edge cases and error handling
- [ ] Optimize for different screen sizes
- [ ] Add game save/load functionality

## Current Status
**Last Updated**: Step 4 mostly completed - AI bot implemented but needs refactoring  
**Next Priority**: Complete Step 4 refactoring, then move to Step 5 (difficulty system)  
**Testing Status**: âœ… Basic AI functionality working, needs thorough testing

## Major Accomplishments
### Step 4 - AI Bot Implementation âœ… (mostly complete)
- âœ… Basic AI that makes random legal moves
- âœ… Human vs AI game mode implemented
- âœ… AI thinking delay and status messages
- âœ… Proper turn management preventing human moves during AI turn
- âœ… Game mode enum and logic separation
- âœ… **NEW**: Last move highlighting for all players (improved UX)

## Critical Issues to Address (Step 4 Completion)
### 1. Code Duplication (HIGH PRIORITY)
- `getValidMoves()` logic is duplicated in `ChessAI.kt` and `ChessBoard.kt`
- `getRookMoves()`, `getBishopMoves()`, `isValidPosition()` are duplicated
- This creates maintenance burden and potential for bugs
- **SOLUTION**: Create shared `ChessLogic.kt` utility class

### 2. Missing UI Features
- No game mode selection on home screen
- No way to restart game
- Limited game status information

### 3. Testing Gaps
- AI move validation needs thorough testing
- Edge cases not fully tested
- Performance testing needed

## Code Structure Improvements Needed
```
Current Structure:
- ChessBoard.kt (contains UI + some game logic)
- ChessAI.kt (contains AI + duplicated game logic)
- ChessModels.kt (missing - needs to be created)

Proposed Structure:
- ChessBoard.kt (UI only)
- ChessAI.kt (AI logic only)
- ChessLogic.kt (shared game logic)
- ChessModels.kt (data classes)
```

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Create `ChessLogic.kt`** - Move shared logic here
2. **Create `ChessModels.kt`** - Move data classes here
3. **Update home screen** - Add game mode selection
4. **Add restart functionality**
5. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure AI works correctly
6. **Then proceed to Step 5** - Difficulty system

## Notes
- **AI bot is functional** but code needs cleanup
- **Human vs AI gameplay working** - AI makes random moves
- **Foundation is solid** for adding difficulty system
- **Major refactoring needed** before proceeding to Step 5
- Current AI makes purely random moves (Level 0.0 equivalent)

## Testing Checklist for Step 4 Completion
- [ ] AI makes only legal moves
- [ ] AI cannot move during human turn
- [ ] Human cannot move during AI turn
- [ ] Game alternates turns correctly
- [ ] AI thinking delay works
- [ ] All piece types move correctly for AI
- [ ] No crashes or exceptions
- [ ] Memory usage acceptable
- [ ] Performance smooth on target device
