## Next Steps

### Core Rules Implementation
- [x] Check detection
- [x] Prevent moves that leave king in check
- [x] Checkmate detection
- [x] Stalemate detection
- [x] Castling (kingside and queenside)
  - [x] Basic implementation
  - [x] King/rook move tracking
  - [ ] Add UI feedback for castling availability
- [ ] En passant capture
  - [ ] Track en passant target square
  - [ ] Implement en passant move validation
- [ ] Pawn promotion
  - [ ] Add promotion UI
  - [ ] Handle promotion in game logic
- [ ] Move counters
  - [ ] Implement halfmove clock (50-move rule)
  - [ ] Update fullmove counter

### Testing
- [ ] Test all special moves
- [ ] Validate endgame conditions
- [ ] Ensure move validation respects all rules

### Error Handling & Validation
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
  - [ ] Implement try-catch blocks for move validation
  - [ ] Add descriptive error messages for invalid moves
  - [ ] Handle edge cases in game state transitions
  - [ ] Validate board state consistency
  - [ ] Add input validation for user interactions

### Game History & Analysis
- [ ] Implement move history system
  - [ ] Store full game history in ChessGameState
  - [ ] Add move list with standard algebraic notation
  - [ ] Support PGN (Portable Game Notation) export/import
- [ ] Add undo/redo functionality
  - [ ] Track game states for undo/redo operations
  - [ ] Add UI controls for undo/redo
  - [ ] Handle special moves (castling, en passant) in history
- [ ] Game analysis features
  - [ ] Display move evaluation scores
  - [ ] Show captured pieces
  - [ ] Add game result tracking (win/loss/draw)

### Code Organization & Architecture
- [ ] Improve separation of concerns
  - [ ] Extract move validation logic from ChessBoard.kt to a dedicated MoveValidator class
  - [ ] Create GameController to manage game flow and state transitions
  - [ ] Separate UI logic from game logic in ChessBoard.kt
  - [ ] Define clear interfaces between components
- [ ] Refactor ChessBoard.kt
  - [ ] Move non-UI logic to appropriate domain classes
  - [ ] Create dedicated view models for UI state
  - [ ] Improve state management

## Future Steps

### Step 6: AI Difficulty System
- [ ] Add difficulty-based move evaluation
- [ ] Implement depth-based search algorithm
- [ ] Create difficulty scaling (0.0-50.0)
- [ ] Add difficulty settings UI

### Step 7: Enhanced UI/UX
- [ ] Hints and move suggestions
- [ ] Captured pieces display
- [ ] Game settings menu
- [ ] Sound effects and animations

### Step 8: Polish & Release
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] App icon and branding
- [ ] Save/load game state
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
